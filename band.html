          <p>Micky is an American actor, musician, television director, radio personality and theater director, best known as a vocalist and drummer of the 1960s pop/rock band the Monkees.</p>
          <p class="band-no-show1">In 1965, Dolenz was cast in the television sitcom The Monkees and became the drummer and a lead vocalist in the band created for the show. He was not actually a drummer and needed lessons even to be able to mime credibly, but eventually was taught how to play properly.</p>
          <p class="band-no-show2">By the time The Monkees went on tour in late 1966, Dolenz was competent enough to play the drums himself.[3] He learned to play right-handed and left-footed because of a leg disease called Perthes making his right leg weak.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="band-info">
          <p>Michael is an American musician, songwriter, actor, producer, novelist, businessman, and philanthropist, best known as a member of the pop rock band the Monkees and co-star of the TV series The Monkees (1966–1968).</p>
          <p class="band-no-show1">From 1965 to early 1970, Nesmith was a member of the television pop-rock band The Monkees, created for the television situation comedy of the same name. According to his May 2015 interview on Gilbert Gottfried's podcast, someone showed him a copy of the famous press advertisement asking for "four insane boys" so he applied for the job.</p>
          <p class="band-no-show2">Nesmith won his role largely by appearing blasé when he auditioned. He wore a wool hat to keep his hair out of his eyes, riding his motorcycle to the audition. Producers Bob Rafelson and Bert Schneider remembered "Wool Hat", and called Nesmith back.</p>

        <div class="band-info">
          <p>Peter is an American musician and actor, best known as the keyboardist and bass guitarist of the Monkees.</p>
          <p class="band-no-show1">Tork was a proficient musician, and though the group was not allowed to play their own instruments on their first two albums, he was an exception, playing what he described as "third chair guitar" on Mike Nesmith's song, "Papa Gene's Blues," from their first album.</p>
          <p class="band-no-show2"> He subsequently played keyboards, bass guitar, banjo, harpsichord, and other instruments on their recordings. He also co-wrote, along with Joey Richards, the closing theme song of the second season of The Monkees, "For Pete's Sake". On the television show, he was relegated to playing the "lovable dummy," a persona Tork had developed as a folk singer in New York's Greenwich Village</p>

          <h4>Vocals</h4>
          <img src="/assets/images/band/dj.jpg" class="img-circle hvr-grow">
        </div>
        <div class="band-info">
          <p>Davy was an English singer-songwriter, musician, actor and businessman best known as a member of the band the Monkees, and for starring in the TV series of the same name.</p>
          <p class="band-no-show1">From 1966 to 1971, Jones was a member of the Monkees, a pop-rock group formed expressly for a television show of the same name. With Screen Gems producing the series, Jones was shortlisted for auditions, as he was the only Monkee who was signed to a deal with the studio, but still had to meet producers Bob Rafelson's and Bert Schneider's standards.</p>
          <p class="band-no-show2">Jones sang lead vocals on many of the Monkees' recordings, including "I Wanna Be Free" and "Daydream Believer".[14] The DVD release of the first season of the show contained commentary from the various bandmates. In Peter Tork's commentary, he stated that Jones was a good drummer and had the live performance lineups been based solely on playing ability, it should have been Tork on guitar, Mike Nesmith on bass, and Jones on drums, with Micky Dolenz taking the fronting role, rather than as it was done (with Nesmith on guitar, Tork on bass, and Dolenz on drums).</p>
