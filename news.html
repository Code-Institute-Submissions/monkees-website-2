            <h2>ANNOUNCING MORE OF THE MONKEES SUPER DELUXE EDITION</h2>
            <h6>Monday, November 6, 2017 - 11:19am</h6>
            <p>Who's ready for even more of MORE?<br>In honor of 50th anniversary this year, we've super-sized MORE OF THE MONKEES with a staggering 91 tracks including 55 previously-unreleased alternate takes, remixes, and newly discovered concert recordings from 1967, the band's earliest-known live tracks, as well as a bonus 7” of “I’m A Believer” (Remix)/”(I’m Not Your) Steppin’ Stone” (Vocals Only).</p>
            <p class="collapse" id="expando-2">
              This is the most exciting archival dig through The Monkees' vault since 2009's THE BIRDS, THE BEES AND THE MONKEES DELUXE EDITION. Every track is newly mastered for this set; the live material is the most historically significant of their career," says Andrew Sandoval, who produced the set and wrote a new essay for its expansive booklet.<br><br> 
              MORE OF THE MONKEES: SUPER DELUXE EDITION significantly expands the special edition of MORE OF THE MONKEES released in 2006. Along with mono and stereo mixes of the original album, the SUPER DELUXE EDITION takes listeners into the studio for the making of the album through extensive studio outtakes. Many make their debut here, including the first recorded versions of: "Words," "Valleri," "Hold On Girl" and more. Backing tracks for early version of "Sometime In The Morning," "I'm A Believer" and "Look Out (Here Comes Tomorrow)" offer a behind-the-scenes perspective on the creative process.<br><br> 
              However, the set's most historic aspect is the inclusion of newly discovered unreleased live music. Recorded in Arizona in 1967, these 10 tracks are The Monkees' earliest-known live recordings. The performance highlights songs from the band's 1966 self-titled debut ("I Wanna Be Free" and "Papa Gene's Blues"), along with covers of Ray Charles' "I Got A Woman" and Willie Dixon's "You Can't Judge A Book By The Cover."<br><br> 
              Limited to just 4,500 numbered copies and housed in a hardbound 7"x7" box, the collection is available exclusively from monkees.com and rhino.com. MORE OF THE MONKEES: SUPER DELUXE EDITION will be available on December 22, but you can pre-order now.

            <h2>THIS DAY IN 1966: THE MONKEES TV</h2>
            <h6>Thursday, December 8, 2016 - 4:42pm</h6>
            <p>50 years ago today, a TV series about four guys who lived together, played in a band, and got the funniest looks from everyone they meet made its debut on NBC.</p>
            <p class="collapse" id="expando-5">
              Yes, that’s right: it was The Monkees. And if you thought it was anything else, then you’ve come to the wrong website.<br> Competing against Gilligan’s Island on CBS and The Iron Horse, an ABC western which starred Dale Robertson as a gambler who becomes a railroad baron, The Monkees aired at 7:30 on Monday nights, just before I Dream of Jeannie. In its first episode, entitled “Royal Flush,” the boys rescued Princess Bettina, the Duchess of Harmonica, from her despicable uncle, Archduke Otto, who was trying to kill her in order to ascend to the throne himself. It probably goes without saying that Davy made Princess Bettina swoon, but in case you haven’t seen the episode in awhile, we’ll remind you of the songs that were featured within: “This Just Doesn’t Seem To Be My Day” and “Take a Giant Step.”<br> Interestingly, while “Royal Flush” may have been the first Monkees episode to air, it was actually the third episode filmed, but that’s the TV business for you.<br> “Royal Flush” was directed by James Frawley, a true TV legend, having directed hundreds of hours of television over the course of his long, illustrious career. Frawley didn’t find his way onto the pilot until after the Monkees themselves had been cast, but he immediately bonded with the guys. “I understood the four boys, they got me,” he told Bruce Fessier of The Desert Sun. “Something clicked, and I felt like I was home.”<br> Clearly, The Monkees clicked with viewers, too: it’s 50 years later, and people still love it.
